 - Each user is a separate namespace in the index. To have an index per user would be way too expensive - 70$ a month.
   So - the user id is the namespace, and separate project - project id;

 - when making a query with metadata filter - the namespace should be provided. Elseway the search will go only over the default namespace,
   which is {namespace : '' }, when omitted. 
  
 - for deletion of vectors by metadata filtering _delete method should be used. The previous note about the namespace is applied as well, 
   as I understand. 
  
  - when using file paths that use ** on mac or linux machines, use curly bracers - 
    "copy-files": "copyfiles -u 1 \"src/public/**\" build/",

  - adding any additional content to the query result by user. 
     Any additional content will be rendered in the widget below the response, that was obtained from the clarify bot backend itself.
     The additional content should be passed as the syncronous or async callback, which resolves with valid HTML code, with inline styles.
     This callback gets the only argument as it is being called on the query from the widget - it is the actual user query.
