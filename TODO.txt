 - create hash based check for the duplicate files on the ingestion.
 - make good errors logging - and user alerting about those in widget.
 - create environment switch mechanism for dev\prod switching of env variables, such as the backend address etc, both for the front and the backend.
 - register a domain name on heroku.
 - [PICABOO] - make the articles scrapper to bypass cloudflare protection.

    - ctrl-c ctrl-v stuff, not working - suppose due to the shadowDOM thing.
    - work on the prompt - so it would not say anyting beyi=ond the context!
    - work on removing that long single response await, when the knowledge base is being ingested. That causes more than 30 sec delay, when there are lot of files - 
    heroku sends 503 to the client in that case. Besides, this would include implementation of some sort of SSR to inform the client on the ingestion progress
    on every ingested file. Heroku article on this :
