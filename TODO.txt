 - make good errors logging - and user alerting about those in widget.
 - create environment switch mechanism for dev\prod switching of env variables, such as the backend address etc, both for the front and the backend.
 - register a domain nam—É.

    - ctrl-c ctrl-v stuff, not working - suppose due to the shadowDOM thing.
    - work on the prompt - so it would not say anyting beyond the context!
