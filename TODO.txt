 - create hash based check for the duplicate files on the ingestion.
 - make good errors logging - and user alerting about those in widget.
 - create environment switch mechanism for dev\prod switching of env variables, such as the backend address etc, both for the front and the backend.

    - ctrl-c ctrl-v stuff, not working - suppose due to the shadowDOM thing.

   - implement some kind of load balancing and ability to benchmark performance under different loads.
