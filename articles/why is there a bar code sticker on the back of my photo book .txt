"Bar code stickers have been added to all hard cover and soft cover Picaboo photo books. This removable sticker is placed on the bottom right corner of the back cover of your photo book. These stickers are part of our production team's order labelling system to improve order verification. This leads to enhanced workflow in manufacturing our custom photo books, as well as greater efficiency in preparing and packing our products to ship. When removing your label, start at one corner and gently peel back. If the label rips during removal, re-start peeling at the opposite side's corner. If any residue remains on the book's cover after label removal, gently rub off the adhesive with your finger or a soft cloth."
