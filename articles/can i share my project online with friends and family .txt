"You can easily share Picaboo Books or Canvas Prints with friends and family via email or Facebook. Picaboo's Share feature creates a web-based preview of your project that you can email. It's a great way to share a book or other project you've created so that friends and family can admire it or purchase a copy. Friends who receive a link to a shared project can't edit it, and they won't see it in their Picaboo library.To email friends and family a link to the web preview of your project:Click on the project in your Library. Click theShare via emailoption in the list that appears below the project. Enter the recipient's email address in the To: field. If sending to multiple recipients, separate the addresses with semicolons. Edit the subject line and message content to your liking and clickSend . Picaboo will email a link to your project to your list of recipients as soon as the preview is ready for sharing. This can take a few minutes, or in some cases more than an hour, depending on the size of your project file.*Currently, the Share feature is limited to these product types.More information on the Share feature"
