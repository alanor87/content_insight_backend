"We are asked this question quite often by professional photographer customers that use Picaboo for wedding books and other projects. We use the latest large-format digital offset printing presses from Hewlett Packard to produce our books. We also print all of our books on a glossy archival quality paper that is elemental chlorine free. All of the materials we use in our books are lignin-free as well. The lifespan of a book, or any printed product, is really dependent on the environment in which the book resides. For example, a book will deteriorate far more rapidly if it's stored in a humid environment rather than a dry one. Large temperature variances will also affect book life. Having said all of that, our books are expected to last a very, very long time. If something were to happen to a book that was ordered (flood, fire, etc), it could always be re-ordered in the exact same format as the original."
