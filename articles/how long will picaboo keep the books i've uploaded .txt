"Picaboo does not delete projects saved by its customers. We maintain all of the projects in your library and store the images. Three months after the photos are uploaded, we archive the images to long-term storage. Moving the images to long-term storage will not impact the experience in the editor. As the technology we utilize changes over time, there is a chance that some data in your projects can be altered.If you're looking to order a project that you previously created, we highly recommend checking the preview to make sure that any program updates have not affected your work. Although we aim for consistency in our updates to the Picaboo editor, some of these may make slight changes in how your project is printed. Preview Mode allows you to see exactly how the project will be printed, so you can make any necessary adjustments."
