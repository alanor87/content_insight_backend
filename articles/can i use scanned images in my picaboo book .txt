"You can definitely include scanned images in your Picaboo book. To convert printed photos and other materials into digital images for use in Picaboo, scan them at 300 dpi or more, and save them as high-quality JPG or PNG files. You will then be able to import these scanned images into Picaboo for use as photos and backgrounds. Tip: For best results, crop any white area out of scanned images in an external program (such as Microsoft Paint) before importing them into Picaboo."
