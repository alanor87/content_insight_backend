"Once you've placed an image on a page, you may decide to swap in another image instead. To replace an image, simply drag the new image from the Media Tray onto the existing image, and then select Replace Photo.If the two images that you wish to swap are on the same page (or the opposite page next to it), simply click on the image, and in the Photo Adjustment Tools panel on the left, you'll see the Swap this Photo icon (see circled icon below). Once you've clicked this icon, you can then click on the other photo you want to swap and they will change places.Return to the Picaboo User Manual"
