"Picaboo Canvas Prints are printed on textured artist canvas fabric using a Seiko Color Painter ink-jet printer. This technology offers archival printing with a life of 90 to 125 years (longer if framed under glass and kept out of direct light). The result is a work of art that you can treasure for a lifetime."
