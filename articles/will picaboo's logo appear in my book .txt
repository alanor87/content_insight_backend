"Classic Custom books have a white vellum end page with a small, discreet Picaboo logo. For our Seamless Lay-flat books and our Mini books, there will be a logo on the inside back cover for books with an even number of pages.If there are an odd number of pages, the last page will be the inside back cover and there will be no logo on the book."
