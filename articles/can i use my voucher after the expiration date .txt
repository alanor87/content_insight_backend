"If you have not redeemed your voucher by the expiration date, the paid value of your voucher will not expire, even though the promotional value has. The paid value can be used towards any product purchase with Picaboo. The paid value cannot be used towards shipping, taxes or the purchase of Gift Cards. For example, if you purchased a voucher for $50 of photo books for $20, and your voucher has expired, when you enter your voucher code in the Promo Code field in the shopping cart, $20 will be deducted from your order total."
