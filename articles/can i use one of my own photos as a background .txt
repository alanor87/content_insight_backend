If you haven't already imported the image you want to use as a background, click the Add Photos button above the Media Tray, select the image/s you want to import, and clickUpload . Then you can drag and drop the image into the background area of your page. Tip: Because some cropping can happen during book production, we recommend keeping important image details (such as people's heads) at least 1/4from the edge of your pages or inside the dashed lines on the pages or covers.
