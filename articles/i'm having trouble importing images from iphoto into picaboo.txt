"Although Picaboo is typically able to easily locate your images in iPhoto, sometimes, the complex directory structure within iPhoto makes it difficult for Picaboo to locate your photos. The easiest way to resolve the problem is to copy your photos to a folder on your hard drive that Picaboo can easily access, such as your desktop. You can temporarily copy the photos there, and once you've imported them successfully, you can delete the temporary folder."
