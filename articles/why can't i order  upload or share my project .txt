"The problem you're having usually indicates something on your computer is interfering with the Picaboo software. This can be caused by a number of issues, but most commonly Picaboo can be blocked by a proxy setting, or an antivirus/firewall program such as McAfee or Norton. McAfee is the most common, and if you're running that you would need to make sure Picaboo is added as a fully allowed program under its firewall.If you're running McAfee, open it up, and then clickFirewallin the main McAfee window. You should then see aSettingsbutton next to Firewall. Click that, and then clickProgram Permissions(or something similar). That will bring up a list of all programs installed on your computer. Scroll through the list until you find Picaboo. Click Picaboo and then click Edit. That will show you a drop-down menu, where you will be able to selectFull.Make sure Picaboo is set to Full, save the changes, and then exit McAfee.If you're not running McAfee or any other antivirus/firewall program, it may be caused by a proxy setting on your computer. To check for that, please follow the steps below:1. Open up your computer's Control Panel. 2. Open up Internet Options. 3. Under the Connections tab, click the Lan Settings button. 4.
