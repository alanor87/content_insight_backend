"Separate orders cannot be combined and will always be shipped separately. Click here to see how to order multiple products in one order. You cannot add products to an order once the order is placed. If you already placed the order, Picaboo allows you to cancel it within 30 minutes of placement. To cancel an order, go to My Account/Order Status/History page and click on the Cancel link.More information on the Ordering process"
