"All of the available fonts are listed within the program. At this time, there isn't an option for importing more fonts. If you don't see what you're looking for in our collection, you can create your own custom pages in an external image editor (such as Photoshop) which gives you the option to use any font you like. If you create custom pages for your book, follow our dimension guidelines depending on what size book you're making. Save your image as a JPEG (preferably with the highest quality setting). Then import the page by clicking “Get Photos” above the photo tray in Picaboo.More information on Captions"
