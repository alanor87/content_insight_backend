"Adding a filter to your image is a fun way to enhance the look of the image and make it stand out. To begin, click on your image, then the Filter/Adjust Photo button on the left. From there, click on Filters.Along the bottom row, you'll see quite a few options to choose from, and a slider bar to view even more. If you click on the menu button on the bottom left, you can select various categories to narrow down your search. Once you've selected a filter, you can also adjust the intensity via the slider bar above the filter options. Once you've completed all changes you'd like to make, you can click on the arrow in the bottom left to return to the list of tools. In the top right, you can either undo the recent changes, or click Save Changes to save all changes made to the image."
