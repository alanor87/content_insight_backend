If you are ordering lay-flat pages, there is no cropping at the center of the spread but there is a seam for the Classic Custom books with lay-flat pages or a fold line for the Seamless Lay-flat books so we don't recommend putting important details in the center seam. We recommend having either an image or background covering the full crop area to avoid having any white border on the page or cover, but at the same time keeping important details out of this area.You can see more aboutwrappingon the Seamless or Custom covers here.The crop zone will display by default when you view your book in Preview mode.More information on the Safety Zone Warning"
