"Picaboo uploads your original images at their full resolution. Your photos are not compressed when you order your book. Tip: If you have very high-resolution images, you can reduce your book file size without compromising print quality by downsampling them to a resolution of 3392x2670 for an 11x9 book; 4192x3300 for an 14x11 book. If your images look blurry in the software, but don't show a low resolution warning, please see the following article:Why do my images look blurry in the software?"
