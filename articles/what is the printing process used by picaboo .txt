"How your book pages are printed depends on which of our book styles you are using to create your book. Generally when we print your book pages, your photos, captions and backgrounds are printed right on the page, like a magazine or brochure. The prints are not pasted or glued on a page like a scrapbook or photo album. Our Classic Custom books with standard pages are printed on 100lb text gloss stock that is acid-free and of archival quality. The texture and thickness can be compared to a coffee table book you would find in a bookstore. For the Lay-Flat pages upgrade, the paper is 65-lb, archival-quality, matte cover stock, which is a bit thicker and features a hinge binding that allows the pages to lay flat. For these book types, we also use Indigo 6 color digital printers with an output at 300 dpi resulting in amazing photo print quality."
