"Once Picaboo has uploaded the photos, the Picaboo App will automatically sort them in your Media Tray according to the date and time they were taken. If you prefer that Picaboo sort your photos alphabetically by file name, click on the More Button&gt;Preferences&gt;Sort Photos By: Filename. If you would like to sort your photos topically (e.g., school days, holidays, pets), it is best to organize them into subject folders before starting your Picaboo project. Then, upload one folder at a time, creating those pages before uploading the next subject folder. You can easily add photos to your book at any time, so working in smaller batches helps stay organized. As you're putting your book together, you can quickly get abird's-eye viewin Page Manager mode. Click the Pages button just to the left of the photo tray to view and sort all of your pages at once.Return to the Picaboo User Manual"
