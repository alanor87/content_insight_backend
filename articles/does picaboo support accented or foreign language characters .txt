"Currently Picaboo does support some accented characters, however they are only available in the Arial font. Therefore you can copy and paste accented letters into the Picaboo software if they were originally in the Arial font, though if they were in a different font I'm afraid our printers may not recognize them correctly. If you wish to use accented characters in a font other than Arial, the only option would be to create an image of the text and then place that image into your book. Otherwise, you could add the text on top of another photo you want to use in your album, such as a background, though both of those options would need to be done using photo editing software outside of Picaboo.More information on Captions"
