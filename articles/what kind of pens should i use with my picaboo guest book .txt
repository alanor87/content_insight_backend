"Thinking of making your Picaboo book into a Guest Book?At this time, due to the variability in the materials used to produce our products, we do not have any recommendations regarding writing in your books. Please note that although most customers do report having success using ball point pens without any smudging issues, if there are any issues related to writing in a book, we will not be able to provide a free replacement."
