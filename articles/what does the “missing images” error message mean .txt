"The “Missing Images” error shows up when a project was closed before all the used images were fully uploaded to our servers. While Picaboo allows you to quickly create a new project and begin editing your pages immediately, it is still necessary to finish uploading all of your imported photos to our servers. This image upload process continues in the background while you are working on your project, and you will see a small “Uploading” progress bar in the upper left.When the uploading process is finished, you will see the word “Saved” appear in the upper right.If your project was closed before the uploading process was complete, you may see this message the next time you open that project:The message above will show up if Picaboo recognizes that one or more used images in your project were not fully uploaded. If you look through your project, you will see an empty image frame where any missing photos used to be located:These means that the photo wasn't saved in your project.If the issue is still happening once you clear your cache and are reviewing the latest version of the project (not a cached version that the browser has saved), you will need to delete any empty image-frames, and re-add the original images. To re-add the original images back into your project, first click the “Add Photos” button in the lower left. Next, select and import the desired image into the project. If selecting files from the same location as you did originally, if some of your images were successfully uploaded, they should not be selectable, to indicate there is no need to import them again. After you have re-imported all of the missing photos, you will need to apply them to the project pages.You will need to click the red message and click the delete key on your keyboard and then reapply the images to that space on the page. If you made adjustments to any images such as rotation, zoom, brightness or contrast, those adjustments will have to be redone."
