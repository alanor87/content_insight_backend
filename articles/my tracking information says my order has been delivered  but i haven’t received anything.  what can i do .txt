"When your order has shipped, you will receive an email notification containing tracking information for your order. Your tracking information may indicate that your order has been successfully delivered however you do not actually have it. Please make sure to always have your order shipped to a safe location where somebody will be available to receive it. Sometimes the postal service will deliver a package to the wrong home in the same general vicinity, so itâ€™s a good idea to check with any nearby neighbors who may have received your order in error. You should also check around any porch areas where the package could have fallen into. We are not able to put a trace on packages which have been marked as delivered by the shipping company. If, however, you still are unable to locate your package, please Contact Us as soon as possible."
